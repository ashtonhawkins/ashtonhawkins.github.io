## Problem
A major product category was suffering from low online conversion and unusually high in-store return rates. Customer feedback revealed the root cause: most returns were due to incorrect sizing or type — not product quality. Customers were buying the wrong products because the website wasn't helping them make informed decisions.

## Insight
The target customer was starting lower in the funnel (she knew what category she wanted) but didn't realize she needed to measure before shopping. Meanwhile, competitors offered educational content, simple language, and visual diagrams that guided customers through the decision process. The retailer's site used industry jargon and offered no educational support.

## Approach
- Conducted extensive SEO keyword research to understand how customers actually searched vs. the terminology used on-site
- Analyzed customer journey data in Adobe Analytics — discovered customers were clicking 5+ pages deep into browse results, indicating they couldn't find what they needed
- Mapped the competitive landscape: identified that top competitors all provided educational content, measurement guides, and visual product comparisons
- Separated two distinct product types into independent shopping experiences (different customers, different needs)
- Revised taxonomy and copy to match customer search language (e.g., moved high-demand terms to top-level navigation, replaced jargon with plain language)
- Added compact educational modules directly on shopping pages addressing the core customer questions
- Created long-form buying guides for the measurement and installation process

## Results
- +1.6% conversion rate improvement
- Measurable decrease in digital return rates
- Established a repeatable framework: customer research → taxonomy audit → content optimization → measurement

## Impact
> "The biggest unlock wasn't a technology change — it was speaking the customer's language and answering questions they didn't know they had."
