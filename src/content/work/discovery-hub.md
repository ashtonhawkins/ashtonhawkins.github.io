## Problem
The existing Home shopping experience on a major retailer's website was entirely transactional. Customers in the discovery phase of their journey — browsing for inspiration, exploring styles — had no dedicated experience. They were dropped into category grids with no editorial guidance.

## Insight
Customer research revealed a core segment of Home shoppers who were in upper-funnel discovery mode. They wanted to explore curated ideas, shop by style, and see real-world inspiration before committing to products. Internal data showed that visitors who engaged with "Shop by Style" pages had significantly higher engagement and transaction rates than those who didn't.

## Approach
- Partnered with Product, UX, and Engineering teams to build a "Discovery Hub" — a curated feed experience at /home/decorating-ideas
- The experience featured editorial curations (shop by style, cover stories, seasonal campaigns) alongside user-generated content from social platforms
- Built a go-to-market strategy to win over internal stakeholders, including data-backed KPI forecasting and an analytics dashboard for monitoring success
- Defined core KPIs: add-to-carts, AOV, CTR, order participation, conversion rate, return visits, and time spent

## Results
- Successfully launched the first editorial-meets-commerce experience for the Home category
- Established a new content-driven acquisition channel with measurable engagement lift
- Created a framework that could be replicated across other departments

## Impact
> "Visitors who engaged with curated experiences converted at meaningfully higher rates — proving that upper-funnel investment compounds into bottom-line growth."
