ogTitle: "Introducing the studio OS"
---

I’ve been quietly building a collection of tools to help independent studios keep momentum without
burning out. The system spans project orchestration, resource planning, and storytelling. It’s built
with Astro on the front end, a GraphQL layer in the middle, and a Notion data bridge for teams that
prefer familiar inputs.

This essay outlines the core principles guiding the work—clarity, calm, and cadence—and explores how
small teams can build their own studio OS without sinking months into bespoke infrastructure.
