Atlas Systems is a custom operations platform that helps a distributed creative team prepare and run
immersive art experiences. The application synchronizes lighting, projection, and audio cues while
providing operators with a calm dashboard for live adjustments.

The build pairs Astro’s island architecture with a WebSocket orchestration layer, enabling real-time
coordination without sacrificing performance for remote directors.
