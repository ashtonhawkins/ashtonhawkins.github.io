  <h1>Now</h1>
  <p>
    I’m in exploration mode—documenting process, refining motion systems, and building connective
    tissue between notes, prototypes, and shipping work. This page will update as the focus shifts.
  </p>
  <h2>Currently</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Designing a toolkit for running live creative workshops entirely in the browser.</li>
    <li>Writing about sustainable pace for independent teams and solo builders.</li>
    <li>Collecting data for an activity stream that will power the new /activity page.</li>
  </ul>
