    <p>
      I’m a hybrid designer-engineer who thrives in the messy middle—where strategy meets shipping
      and storytelling meets systems. Over the last decade I’ve built internal tools, audience
      platforms, and live event systems for teams from early-stage startups to global brands.
    </p>
    <p>
      My practice is grounded in curiosity and craft. I sketch in code, iterate in public, and
      obsess over the small touches that make digital experiences feel human. If a product moves,
      I want it to move with intent.
    </p>

      Beyond client work, I’m exploring spatial computing, knowledge gardening, and how independent
      teams can punch above their weight with the right tooling. This site is my hub for that
      research—expect experiments, notes, and plenty of in-progress thinking.
    </p>
    <h2>What I’m great at</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Designing adaptive systems and design languages that scale with teams.</li>
      <li>Building performant, accessible web apps with Astro, React, and modern APIs.</li>
      <li>Leading cross-disciplinary crews from discovery through launch.</li>
      <li>Turning complex requirements into interfaces people actually enjoy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Outside of screens you’ll find me running long-distance, playing piano, or tinkering with
      modular synth patches. Let’s build something resonant together.
