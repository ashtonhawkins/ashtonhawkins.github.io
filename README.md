# Ashton Hawkins Personal Site
This repo contains the Astro + Tailwind site for ashtonhawkins.com.

## Branching note
The active branch is `main`; earlier work-in-progress lived on `work` locally. If your clone still shows only `work`, rename it to `main` (`git branch -m main`) so deployments and previews align with the default branch.

## Previewing locally
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:4321/about` to view the Personal OS page.
